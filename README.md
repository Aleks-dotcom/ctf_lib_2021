# ctf_lib
This are the archived ctfs I played in 2020 and 2021, hope it helps someone xD
This is in no way structured and should not be treated as such, it is as I leave it when I am done with a ctf
which means it is usually messy, not well organized and doesn't make much sense.
In general i mostly solve pwn challs and so that is whay you will find here. If I have manged to solve the challenge then there will be a sol.py or ex.py script in the directory of the challenge.
