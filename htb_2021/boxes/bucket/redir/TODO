Unordered list of TODO items.


Testing
-------

We should add an automated test framework to be run automatically with
Travis-CI.  At least some simple netcat non-privileged port test should
be possible.

Test transparent proxy support, since v2.3 that feature has not been
looked at even once.  See the Linux Documentation/networking/tproxy.txt
for more information.  My guess is that it'll take some effort to get it
working in redir again.

Non-forking server
------------------

I'm thinking of eventually doing a version which never forks, but does
one big-honking-select-loop, which probably wouldn't be much of a
bother, and would save a good chunk of ram, but then an FD limit becomes
quite a real possibility.  perhaps an #ifdef selecting the old or new
code would help this...  though, really, this is a known problem with a
lot of proxies, and it doesn't seem to hurt too bad.  depends on the
`MAX_FDS` (or whatever that define is. `FD_MAX`?) on your machine.
